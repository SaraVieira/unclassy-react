# React is constantly changing

---

# One of the latest one is hooks

---

# To understand let's look at a class component

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code/class.js')}
  lang="jsx"
  theme={nightOwl}
/>

# React relayed on lifecycle methods

## it also relayed on classes

---

- constructor()
- componentDidMount()
- shouldComponentUpdate()
- componentDidUpdate()
- componentWillUnmount()
- render()

---

# React Classes are not really classes

## that's kinda of confusing

---

# Hooks

---

# A new way to write react apps

## not so reliant on classes

---

# A more functional react

---

# Live coding

## Wish me luck ðŸ¤ž
